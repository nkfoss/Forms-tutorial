### How does Angular create forms?

#### Template-driven approach
We can add ngModel in the input elements. This tells Angular that the input is a 'control' of the form. This is followed the 'name' attribute, which is how that field is represented in the form. A form is essentially just a set of key/value pairs, where the 'name' is the key, and the user input is the value.
